# Bcrypt Demo
## The most basic encrypted login

### Set up demo

* install npm - npm init -y
* install bcryptjs and nodemon
* in package.json add start script: nodemon demo.js
* to run type npm run start
* require bcryptjs

## This portion of code will be in the registration part of login-exercise
### Make a user with an encrypted password

* makePassword function takes in a password, is asynchronous
* hard code a user
* await the generation of a salt - so that it does not return undefined
* console.log the salt
* bcryptjs takes in password and salt
* run the function and display salted/hashed password

## This portion of code will be in the login
### Compare the user's password in the database with password entered upon logging in

* async function comparePassword takes in a password and a hashed password
* the function awaits bcryptjs method compare(); compares the two passwords and returns a boolean
* if passwords match, then the user is authenticated and can enter the site
* if the passwords don't match, then the user is not authenticated and can be directed to retry
